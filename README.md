This project is part of the Web-Project course. The goal is to create a functional restaurant web application that allows users to manage reservations, orders, and menus. The application aims to handle data inconsistencies and errors gracefully while providing a user-friendly interface.

This is a comprehensive restaurant management frontend application that allows users to:

- Order food and make reservations.
